the compiler is part of the language-processing system.

a language-processing system consists of several components:
  -preprocessor:   source program -> preprocessor -> modified source program. using c language for example, this component will process the #include directives)
  -compiler: modified source program -> compiler -> target assembly program(not binary yet, but low-level in texual form)
  -assembler: target assembly program -> assembler -> relocatable machine code(now is binary code, stored as object files)
  -linker/loader: relocatable machine code/library files/relocatable object files  -> linkker/loader -> targetmachine code (link multiple object files)

we can split the compiler into two parts:
  -analysis(front end): creates an intermediate representation of the source program, collects information about the source program to build a symbol table.
  -synthesis(back end): constructs the target assembly program from the intermediate representation and symbol table.

we can also split the compile process into several phases:
  -lexical analysis
  -syntax analyzsis
  -semantic analysis
  -intermediate code generation
  -code optimization
  -code generation
  some of thess phases may group into a pass(read an input file and writes an output file).
  for example, we can group lexical analysis, syntax analyzsis, semantic analysis and intermediate code generation phases into one pass called "front-end pass",
               code optimization might be an optional pass,
               code generation could be a "back-end pass".

there are some commonly used compiler-construction tools:
  -parser generators: produce syntax analyzers
  -scanner generators: product lexical analyzers
  -syntax-directed translation engines: produce routines for walking a parse tree and generating intermediate code
  -code-generator genreators: produce code generators
  -data-flow analysis engines: key part of code optimization, gathering information about how values are transmitted from one part of the program to each other part.
  -compiler-construction toolkits: provide an integrated set of routines for constructing various phases of a compiler.
